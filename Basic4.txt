In python everything is really treated as objects
class : A class is a special data type which defines how to build a certain kind of oobject.
Instances : Are the objects that are created which follow the definitiongiven inside of the class

__int__()  - serves as a constructor for the class and does some initialization work
The "self" argument is the reference of the current instance of the class

Attributes :
1.Data Attribute : variable owned by a particular instance of a class 
2.Class Attribute : Owned by the class as a whole

NOTE : Other definitons were written in the sample3.py  file
